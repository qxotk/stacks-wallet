        You must first accept the terms of service before using the Stacks Wallet
      </OnboardingText>
      <Box textStyle="body.small" mx="base">
        These terms of use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your use of the Stacks Wallet software
        (the “<strong>Software</strong>”) made available to you by {FULL_ENTITY_NAME} (“
        <strong>{ENTITY_NAME}</strong>”). By clicking “I Accept,” downloading, installing,
        accessing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by the following terms and
        conditions.
        <Box as="ol">
          <Box as="li" mt="base">
            <strong>Address Generation</strong>. The Software allows you to generate a
            private-public key pair (your “<strong>Keys</strong>”) for receiving Stacks
            cryptocurrency (<strong>“Stacks”</strong>) and also enables the optional use of a
            hardware wallet for storing your Keys. Use of a hardware wallet is always recommended
            for enhanced security. {ENTITY_NAME.toUpperCase()} DOES NOT HOLD YOUR KEYS FOR YOU. WE
            CANNOT ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT OR RECOVER YOUR KEYS. IF YOU NEED TO RESTORE YOUR WALLET, YOU
            MUST ENTER THE SEED PHRASE PROVIDED WHEN YOU FIRST CREATE A NEW WALLET. YOU ARE SOLELY
            RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFEGUARDING YOUR KEYS AND THE SEED PHRASE. The Software does not
            support all hardware wallets, which are made by third parties, and {ENTITY_NAME} has no
            control, responsibility, or liability with respect to such third-party hardware wallets.
          </Box>
          <Box as="li" mt="base">
            <strong>Transactions</strong>. The Software allows you to initiate transactions for
            sending Stacks. You acknowledge and agree that sending Stacks requires nonrefundable
            transaction fees that you must pay in Stacks. Transaction fees are awarded automatically
            to independent third-party miners by the network protocol. {ENTITY_NAME} has no
            responsibility, control, or influence over transactions and transaction fees. Once a
            transaction is initiated, it cannot be revoked or cancelled, and no return or refund of
            funds or transaction fees is possible. You understand and agree that you are solely
            responsible for compliance with all applicable laws when transacting Stacks, including
            but not limited to securities laws, money transmitter laws, BitLicense regulations, and
            sanctions and anti-money laundering laws
          </Box>
          <Box as="li" mt="base">
            <strong>Stacking</strong>. The Software allows you to participate in Stacking, which is
            a feature of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain in which you may earn Bitcoin rewards by locking
            a dynamic minimum amount of Stacks and publishing useful information on the network. The
            dynamic minimum amount of Stacks you must lock to participate fluctuates based on
            overall participation in Stacking. This threshold is 0.025% of the participating amount
            of Stacks when participation is between 25% and 100%, and when participation is below
            25%, the threshold level is 0.00625% of the liquid supply of Stacks. You must also
            submit a valid Bitcoin address for receiving Bitcoin rewards. Once submitted, you cannot
            change the Bitcoin address for the number of cycles you have chosen to lock your Stacks,
            and you understand and agree that any rewards sent to the submitted Bitcoin address will
            be controlled by the owner of the Bitcoin address. The amount of Bitcoin you might
            receive depends on a large number of unpredictable factors, including the price of
            Stacks, the price of Bitcoin, Bitcoin transaction fees, Stacks transaction fees, the
            number of miners, the number of Stacking participants, and many other factors.
            {ENTITY_NAME} makes no representations or guarantees as to how much Bitcoin you may earn
            from Stacking. You acknowledge and agree that participation in Stacking is entirely
            optional and done at your own risk. {ENTITY_NAME} has no responsibility, control, or
            influence over Stacking, which occurs through network protocols and not via the
            Software, which operates as only one possible way to access Stacking. You further
            understand and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable
            laws when participating in Stacking, including but not limited to securities laws, money
            transmitter laws, BitLicense regulations, and sanctions and anti-money laundering laws.
            You further understand and agree that receipt of Bitcoin rewards may be considered
            taxable income in your jurisdiction, and you are solely and fully responsible for any
            and all applicable taxes.
          </Box>
          <Box as="li" mt="base">
            <strong>Delegation</strong>. The Software allows you to delegate Stacks held in a wallet
            address you control to a third-party delegate for the purpose of Stacking. By delegating
            your Stacks, although you are not transferring your Stacks, you acknowledge and agree
            that you are allowing the delegate to lock your Stacks for Stacking at your own risk. As
            a result, the delegate will control where the Bitcoin rewards for such Stacking are
            distributed. Hiro has no control, responsibility, or liability with respect to the
            distribution of such Bitcoin rewards. If your delegate does not distribute Bitcoin
            rewards to you for Stacks you have delegated, your sole recourse will be against your
            delegate. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that at your own risk the delegate will
            control how long to lock your Stacks for Stacking, up to a maximum of 12 cycles. As a
            result, although you may cancel your delegation at any time, your Stacks may remain
            locked and unavailable for up to 12 cycles even after cancelation of delegation. Hiro
            has no control, responsibility, or liability with respect unlocking Stacks that have
            been locked for Stacking.
